#

# What is the probability that someone with red predominant colour is selected from the class?

# What is the probability that someone with red predominant colour wearing glasses is selected from the class?

# What is the probability that someone with blue or black predominant colour is selected from the class?

# Create a vector containing 10,000 randomly generated values of a white-noise distribution, values ranging from 10 to 100. 

# Produce a histogram and learn to use arguments that we have not covered in class (use ?hist() to get more information). 

# Create a vector containing 10,000 randomly generated values of a normal distribution, values ranging from 10 to 100.

# Produce a histogram and use arguments that we have not covered in class (use ?hist() to get more information).
