## Lab Homework 8

## 1. This exercise involves your kitchen drawer containing cutlery. 
## Count the number of forks, knives, spoons and anything else that 
## you might find in the drawer. Create a vector with character values 
## of the contents of your cutlery drawer. Compute the probabilities of 
## each of the items that could be picked from the drawer (similarly to 
## the black-and-white ball exercise during class). Save part computations 
## as variables and keep your work organized and concise.


## 2. You will conduct a naturalistic observation for this part of the homework. 
## Situate yourself somewhere on campus where you can observe people entering through a
## door over a 10 minute interval (e.g., psychology lab, a lounge area, library). Use a timer 
## (e.g., on your smartphone). Record the number of people who pass each 1-minute interval. 
## Create a vector of the values you recorded. 

## Location of recording

## Vector

## What is the probability that you see 10 or more people pass through your observed area?

## What is the probability that you see no-one (0) pass through your observed area?
