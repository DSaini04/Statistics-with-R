# Homework 6

# Last lecture we loaded a real-world data set from the Surrey city website. In this homework, you will continue to work with these data sets. 

# 1. Load the inspection reports data set (http://data.surrey.ca/dataset/948e994d-74f5-41a2-b3cb-33fa6a98aa96/resource/30b38b66-649f-4507-a632-d5f6f5fe87f1/download/fraserhealthrestaurantinspectionreports.csv)

# 2. Create two filtered variables, one that contains only "Routine" inspections, and another that contains only "Follow-Up" inspections. 

# 3. How many routine, and how many follow-up inspections does the data set contain?

# 4. Which are the top 5 restaurants (identified by tracking number) that receive the most routine visits?

# 5. Which are the top 5 restaurants (identified by tracking number) that receive the most follow-up visits?

# 6. Create a custom function that calculates variance of a variable.

# 7. Using your new custom function, compute the variance of the NumCritical and NumNonCritical values, separately for routine and follow-up visits.
