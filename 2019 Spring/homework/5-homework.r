## Practicing subsetting. 
## Insert your answer below each question. 


## Subsetting vectors and data frames has a similar structure. Use a square bracket [ ] with a data frame 
## or a vector variable to select or filter the data according various rules

##
## Vector subsetting
##

## Load this vector (hours of sleep) we generated some weeks ago
var1 <- c(45,49,46,48,49,42,50,42,20,50,49,56,49,40,56,42,45,49,50,56,46,56,35,38,56,56,53,40,42,50)

# Select the fifth element in the list

# Select the 2nd through the 10th element on the list

##
## Data frame subsetting
## Data frame subsetting is complex because there are multiple columns of values
##

## Your class data has been posted as a csv file. Load this URL into a data frame:

# Select all those students who do not drink any caffeine. Save this selected data as a new data frame.

# Create a separate data frame for those who drink any amount of caffeine.

# Compute the mean of hours worked for those who drink caffein vs those who do not.

# Select all those students who have more than 50 hours of weekly screen time. 

# Select all those students' records who have less than 50 hours of weekly screen time. 

# Repeat the mean calculations of hours worked for each of these two groups.
